# Built-In Events

Up until now, we've manually added event listeners to enable interactivity.

However, some tags expect to be interactive:

- buttons
- anchors
- forms

---

## Buttons

`<button>` elements listen for `onclick` events.

This is how the browser knows to change the button's styling to appear like it's being pushed down when someone clicks.

---

## Anchors

- `<a>` elements listen for `onclick` events so it knows when to send you to the linked location.

> Note: We can link to other pages or other spots within the same page.

---

## Internal Anchors

- We've used links that send you to different pages, but what about farther down the same page?
- We can use the `id` attribute of elements to use `<a>` to send us to a different part _of the same page_.
- We use the `id selector #` in the `href` attribute to do this.

```html
<a href="#pizza">üçï</a>
<a href="#burger">üçî</a>

<h2 id="pizza">Clicking üçï sends you here.</h2>

<p>Content in between gets skipped, since that's the point.</p>

<h2 id="things">Clicking üçîsends you here.</h2>
```

## Forms

`<form>` tags listen for `onsubmit` events to know when to send your form input somewhere.

`onsubmit` events trigger the following behaviors:

- The browser redirects to the URL from the `action` attribute.
  - `<form action="https://example.com">`
  - If no `action` attribute exists, it refreshes the page.
- It attaches a **query string** to the `action` URL

  - The key/value pairs being the `name` of each input, and the `value` for that input.

  > [Query strings allow you to save information like you would in an object but in a string instead.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

---

## Forms Cont.

`<form>` tags are used to group `<input>` tags together.

```html
<form>
  <label>
    First Name:
    <input type="text" name="first-name" />
  </label>
</form>
```

- The browser listens for typing in these inputs.
- When `onsubmit` is triggered, the browser collects the data from these `<input>`s.

## Forms and HTTP

You may have noticed `method="POST"` in the previous example.

**HTTP** is HyperText Transfer _Protocol_, meaning the rules we follow when we transfer text data.

- `method` is what we are doing witht the data
  - GET - asking to read data
  - POST - saving data
  - PUT - editing data
  - DELETE - deleting data
- `action` is the URL we submit data to

Combined, we can send data to other sites and tell those sites what we want them to do with said data.

---

## Using JavaScript with Forms

- We can use JavaScript to add _submit handler_ function.
- This function will be invoked when the `onsubmit` event fires.
  - i.e. the user clicks "Submit"
- The `Event` and its data is passed to your _submit handler_ function as an argument _before_ being sent to a server.
- This lets you modify data, execute other code, or _cancel_ the submission.
- When using JavaScript with a form, you may want to stop the automatic refresh behavior by doing one of these:
  - `<form href="#">` in your HTML
  - `event.preventDefault();` as the first line in your _submit handler_ block.

---

## Form submission: how does it work?

1. The user enters some values into the form elements
2. The form begins to submit as a result of one of these behaviors:

- clicking "Submit"
- pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> while in a text field
- or JavaScript calls `form.submit()` on the form DOM element

3. The user's computer (**client**) sends an HTTP request

- The data from the form is included as a **query string** like `?item=apple&submit=Search`

# URLs

- **U**niform
- **R**esource
- **L**ocator

## URL Subparts

<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL/mdn-url-all.png" width="100%" />

---

## Scheme

- `http` - the basics
- `https` - "S" means "Secure"
- `file` - local filesystem

many others...

---

## Domain

`www.example.com`

> The domain indicates which Web server is being requested. Usually this is a domain name, but an IP address may also be used (but this is rare as it is much less convenient).

---

## Port

http://localhost:**8080**

> The technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server. It is usually omitted if the web server uses the standard ports of the HTTP protocol (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS). Otherwise, it is mandatory.

---

## Path

musical-notes.com<b>/bands/heart</b>

> The path to the resource on the server. A path like this used to represent a physical file location on the server. Nowadays, servers handle it, and it does not really have any physical reality.

---

## Queries

The _query_ is `?category=folk&date=1977` and the _query parameters_ are:

- `&` to separate parameters from each other
- `=` to separate individual parameter names from values

| name     | value  |
| -------- | ------ |
| category | `folk` |
| date     | `1977` |

---

## Queries Continued

Let's examine this Google Search query.

`google.com/search?q=search+term+here&client=safari&source=hp&ei=-q8dYtzgFteqqtsP4My7kA8&iflsig=AHkkrS4AAAAAYh2-CkSzCp-mn5nVyQmW52EWqnjRaD1P&ved=0ahUKEwjcxdjzl6T2AhVXlWoFHWDmDvIQ4dUDCAw&uact=5&oq=search+term+here`

```txt
google.com/search?
  q=search+term+here
  &client=safari
  &source=hp
  &ei=-q8dYtzgFteqqtsP4My7kA8
  &iflsig=AHkkrS4AAAAAYh2-CkSzCp-mn5nVyQmW52EWqnjRaD1P
  &ved=0ahUKEwjcxdjzl6T2AhVXlWoFHWDmDvIQ4dUDCAw
  &uact=5&oq=search+term+here
```

## URL Encoding

Any "special" characters in a URL are "escaped" (encoded) as hexadecimal using [percent-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)

- space becomes `+` or `%20`
- `-` becomes `%2B`
- `%` becomes `%25`
- Other punctuation marks
- Non-ASCII Unicode characters

e.g. `http://example.com/Âºï„ÅçÂâ≤„Çä.html`

becomes `http://example.com/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8D%E5%89%B2%E3%82%8A.html`

---

## URL Encoding with Query Parameters

Combining query parameter encoding and percent-encoding can lead to complex URLs.

URL: `http://musical-notes.com/bands/search?category=80%27s+Rock+Bands&page=2`

Query: `?category=80%27s+Rock+Bands&page=2`

Query Parameter: `category=80%27s+Rock+Bands`

- `%27` becomes `'`
- `+` becomes a space

| name     | value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| category | `80's Rock Bands` |
| page     | `2`               |

---

## Accessing Query Parameters in JavaScript

`document.location.search` returns the URL's query string.

Remember, `search` is a synonym for `query`.

This does not parse the string into an object for you.
`?x=1&y=2` ==/==> `{x: 1, y: 2}`

Instead, you can use [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) to do that for you.

```js
let params = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search);
let name = params.get("name");
```

---

## Anchors

example.com/users/alex<b>#profile</b>

- Anchors lead to another part of the resource itself. It acts as a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource.
- HTML: the browser will scroll to the point where the anchor is defined.
- Video or Audio: the browser will try to go to the time the anchor represents.
- The part after the #, also known as the fragment identifier, is never sent to the server with the request.
- You can access this data by itself using `document.location.hash`.
